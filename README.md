### 2-1. initial_test
1. Basic data preprocessing, visualization, and EDA
- line chart
- histogram
2. Used 'Dickey-Fuller Test' whether the data is stationary or notebook.
3. Estimating and Eliminating Trend using Exponential Weighted Moving Average, Differencing.
4. Basic data prediction using LSTM(Arima: Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) but failed due to wrong starting point(train test data split).
